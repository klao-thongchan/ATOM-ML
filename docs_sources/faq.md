### 1. Is this package related to the text editor?

There is, indeed, a text editor with the same name and a similar logo as this
package. Is this a shameless copy? No. When I started the project, I didn't
know about the text editor, and it doesn't require much thinking to come up
with the idea of replacing the letter O of the word atom with the image of
an atom.

### 2. How does ATOM relate to AutoML?

ATOM is not an AutoML tool since it does not automate the search for
an optimal pipeline like well known AutoML tools such as
[auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) or
[TPOT](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/) do. Instead, ATOM helps
the user find the optimal pipeline himself. One of the goals of this
package is to help data scientists produce explainable pipelines, and
using an AutoML black box function would impede that. That said, it is
possible to integrate a TPOT pipeline with atom through the
[automl](../API/ATOM/atomclassifier/#automl) method.

<br>

### 3. Is it possible to run deep learning models?

Yes. Deep learning models can be added as custom models to the pipeline
as long as they follow [sklearn's API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects).
If the dataset is 2-dimensional, everything should work normally. If
the dataset has more than 2 dimensions, often the case for images, only
a subset of atom's methods will work. For more information, see the
[deep learning](../user_guide/models/#deep-learning) section of the user guide.

<br>

### 4. Can I run atom's methods on just a subset of the columns?

Yes, all [data cleaning](../user_guide/data_cleaning) and
[feature engineering](../user_guide/feature_engineering) methods accept
a `columns` parameter to only transform the selected features. For example,
to only impute the numerical columns in the dataset we could type
`atom.impute(strat_num="mean", columns=atom.numerical)`. The parameter
accepts column names, column indices, dtypes or a slice object.

<br>

<a name="q5"></a>
### 5. How can I compare the same model on different datasets?

In many occasions you might want to test how a model performs on datasets
processed with different pipelines. For this, atom has the [branch system](../user_guide/data_management/#branches).
Create a new branch for every new pipeline you want to test and use the plot
methods to compare all models, independent of the branch it was trained on.

<br>

<a name="q6"></a>
### 6. Can I train models through atom using a GPU?

Yes. Refer to the [user guide](../user_guide/gpu) to see what algorithms
and models have a GPU implementation. Be aware that it requires additional
software and hardware dependencies.

<br>

<a name="q7"></a>
### 7. How are numerical and categorical columns differentiated?

The columns are separated using a dataframe's [select_dtypes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.select_dtypes.html)
method. Numerical columns are selected using `include="number"`
whereas categorical columns are selected using `exclude="number"`.

<br>

<a name="q8"></a>
### 8. Can I run unsupervised learning pipelines?

No. As for now, ATOM only supports supervised machine learning pipelines.
However, various unsupervised algorithms can be chosen as strategy in the
[Pruner](../API/data_cleaning/pruner) class to detect and remove outliers
from the dataset.

<br>

<a name="q9"></a>
### 9. Is there a way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot?

No. Unfortunately, there is no way to plot multiple models in the same
[shap plot](../user_guide/plots/#shap) since the plots are made by the [shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
package and passed as matplotlib.axes objects to atom. This means
that it's not within the reach of this package to implement such a
utility.

<br>

<a name="q10"></a>
### 10. Can I merge a sklearn pipeline with atom?

Yes. Like any other transformer, it is possible to add a sklearn
pipeline to atom using the [add](../API/ATOM/atomclassifier/#add)
method. Every transformer in the pipeline is merged
independently. The pipeline is not allowed to end with a model
since atom manages its own models. If that is the case, add the
pipeline using `atom.add(pipeline[:-1])`.

<br>

<a name="q11"></a>
### 11. Is it possible to initialize atom with an existing train and test set?

Yes. If you already have a separated train and test set you can initialize
atom in two ways:

* `atom = ATOMClassifier(train, test)`
* `atom = ATOMClassifier((X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test))`

Make sure the train and test size have the same number of columns! If
atom is initialized in any of these two ways, the `test_size` parameter
is ignored.

<br>

<a name="q12"></a>
### 12. Can I train the models using cross-validation?

Applying cross-validation means transforming every step of the pipeline
multiple times, each with different results. Doing this would prevent
ATOM from being able to show the transformation results after every
pre-processing step, which means losing the ability to inspect how a
transformer changed the dataset. For this reason, it is not possible to
apply cross-validation until after a model has been trained. After a
model has been trained, the pipeline is defined, and cross-validation
can be applied using the [cross_validate](../API/models/gnb/#cross-validate)
method. See [here](../examples/multi_metric) an example using cross-validation.

### 13. Is there a way to process datetime features?
Yes, the [FeatureExtractor](../API/feature_engineering/feature_extractor)
class can automatically extract useful features (day, month, year, etc...)
from datetime columns. The extracted features are always encoded to numerical
values, so they can be fed directly to a model.
