## Seasonality

 It refers to the regular and repeating pattern of variation in data
 that occurs at specific intervals of time. It's associated with seasonal 
 effects, which are patterns that tend to recur at consistent intervals.
 
The same period is used for all columns in a [multivariate][] setting.

## Forecasting with regressors

No in-sample predictions, so scores on training set are `NaN`.
