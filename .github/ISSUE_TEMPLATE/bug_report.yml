      label: Steps to reproduce
      description: >
        Please add a [minimal code example](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/minimal_reproducer.html)
        that can reproduce the error when running it. Be as succinct as possible,
        **do not depend on external data files**: instead you can generate synthetic
        data using `numpy.random`, [sklearn.datasets.make_regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html),
        [sklearn.datasets.make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) 
        or a few lines of Python code. Example:

        ```python
        from atom import ATOMClassifier
        from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

        X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)

        atom = ATOMClassifier(X, y, random_state=1)
        atom.run("OLS", errors="raise")
        ```

        If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link it
        in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

        In short, **we are going to copy-paste your code** to run it and we expect
        to get the same result as you.

        We acknowledge that crafting a minimal reproducible code example requires
        some effort on your side but it really helps the maintainers quickly reproduce
        the problem and analyze its cause.

        Paste or describe the results you observe instead of the expected results.
        If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the
        **full traceback** of the exception. For instance the code above raises the
        following exception:

        ```python-traceback
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
        <ipython-input-1-a674e682c281> in <module>
              6 atom = ATOMClassifier(X, y, random_state=1)
        ----> 7 atom.run("OLS", errors="raise")

        ValueError: The OrdinaryLeastSquares model is not available for multilabel classification tasks!
        ```

        Please paste or specifically describe the actual output or traceback.
