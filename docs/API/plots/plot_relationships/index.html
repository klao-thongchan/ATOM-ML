<p>Creates a grid of axes such that each numerical column appears
once on the x-axes and once on the y-axes. The bottom triangle
contains scatter plots (max 250 random samples), the diagonal
plots contain column distributions, and the upper triangle
contains contour histograms for all samples in the columns.</p>
